        "\n",
        "## 2. Why did they collect it?\n",
        "The data was collected for a study titled 'Opportunities and Risks arising from Covid-19,' aimed at understanding how Covid-19 has affected London's rental market. To do this, it's important to look at Covid-19 case and death numbers because they show how the pandemic has impacted people's decisions on renting. We're checking how Airbnb listings have changed over time and if these changes are linked to the pandemic's spread. We also want to see if apartments leaving Airbnb are being rented out long-term instead. Including health data helps explain why the rental market moves in certain ways during the pandemic.\n",
        "The research also involves examining the entry to and exit from the Airbnb marketplace by comparing snapshots of London's rental data at different time points. The goal is to assess how the pandemic has influenced these markets and to make inferences about the movement of properties between Airbnb and the long-term rental sector. This requires making reasonable assumptions, such as whether all flats withdrawn from Airbnb are re-entered into the long-term rental market, and these assumptions need to be documented and justified within the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. How was the data collected?  \n",
        "Although the exact methods of data collection are not specified in the information provided, it is inferred that Airbnb data may have been harvested from public listings on the Airbnb platform or through an API made available by Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/). For the COVID-19 infection and death data, the likely source is the Office for National Statistics' (ONS) website. These datasets have undergone a rigorous data cleaning process, an essential step to ensure accuracy and reliability. The data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and filtering irrelevant information to hone in on pertinent data points. Moreover, to enable a more granular analysis, the Airbnb dataset was further refined by selecting listings from February, April, June, August, October, and December of 2020 as a detailed time-scale for subsequent examination.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data analysis techniques are illustrated in the `Covid-19.py` script, which include reading CSV files for structured data storage, merging datasets to correlate diverse sources of information, employing geospatial data, and generating visualizations for an enhanced interpretive experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python, a staple in data science, is utilized for these tasks, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis; Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization; and GeoPandas for geospatial data handling; Functions like `pd.read_csv()` read data from CSV files, `gpd.read_file()` is used for geospatial data, and the `plot` method creates maps and other graphical data representations. \n",

In long-term rental markets, where rentals last for longer periods of time, errors in rental dates may be more significant, affecting the completeness and accuracy of the study. In the short-term rental market, the rental duration is shorter, so this error may be relatively small and will not have a big impact on the study.\n",
        "\n",
        "Taken together, conclusions based on approximate data may not apply to all rental situations. For example, errors may be more significant in certain areas or specific rental types, so caution is needed when generalizing findings. The accuracy of research is limited by data collection methods, and policymakers and market participants need to be aware of these limitations so that they can be considered when making decisions.\n",
