Firstly, let me tell you how much I really enjoy being a member of the Airbnb community.  I am beyond delighted to have been awarded Superhost status in my first three months of hosting. A big thanks to everyone for giving me such great reviews, and thank you all for coming - I loved hosting you! 
From the pictures I think that you can guess that I love art, especially abstract art. I also really enjoy making my home beautiful and sparkling clean  for you to enjoy. I am constantly up dating my rooms so that they are even better for you all to enjoy. I am a recently retired mathematics teacher. In my younger years I was a classical actress and I love all the arts: theatre, classical music and reading. I love Europe and consider myself to be European. What really pleases me is when guests take up my offer of breakfast (you don't have to do it every day!) because that gives me a chance to meet you, and find out how I can make you stay even better!

Mayfair is roughly bordered by Hyde Park to the west, Oxford Street to the north, Piccadilly and Green Park to the south and Regent Street to the east. Most of the area was first developed between the mid 17th century and the mid 18th century as a fashionable residential district, by a number of landlords, the most important of them the Grosvenor family. The Rothschild family bought up large areas of Mayfair in the 19th century. The freehold of a large section of Mayfair also belongs to the Crown Estate (owned by the sovereign – at this time the queen). Mayfair is perfectly located for shopping and entertainment. Famous establishments include Savile Row, Burlington Arcade, the Ritz Hotel and the West End theatre district. New and Old Bond Street, known for fine jewellery, antiques and clothing is also nearby. This is also home to Sotheby's, one of Mayfair's oldest and most respected auction houses.<br /><br />Mayfair",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/25e12eff-0412-4a48-89dd-d7919e9eaa00.jpg,47334723,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/47334723,Graham & Lolita,2015-10-24,"London, United Kingdom","Happy, fun, friendly & outgoing ",within an hour,100%,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/92b11b24-ad6a-45af-b11e-92d91187f735.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/92b11b24-ad6a-45af-b11e-92d91187f735.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Mayfair,3.0,3.0,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"London, England, United Kingdom",Westminster,,51.51336,-0.15567,Private room in rental unit,Private room,2,,1 private bath,,1.0,"[""Bathtub"", ""Shampoo"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Dryer"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Hot water"", ""Iron"", ""Host greets you"", ""First aid kit"", ""Washer"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Heating"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Oven"", ""Refrigerator"", ""TV"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Essentials"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Stove"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Hangers""]",1000.0,30,1125,30.0,30.0,1125.0,1125.0,30.0,1125.0,,t,30,60,90,180,2023-09-06,41,0,0,2016-09-09,2020-02-04,4.88,4.95,4.85,4.9,5.0,4.98,4.85,,f,3,1,2,0,0.48

Love cooking, eating, and experiencing different cuisines, meaning I'm always looking out for new restaurants to try and dishes to cook.

For exercise I'm trying to learn some gymnastics at the moment (slow progress) and enjoy training outdoors, or just going walking and cycling.

I'm a coffee fan (addict....?) so at home I have several different ways of making coffee and usually 2-3 different beans on the go. Right now I'm playing around with making Turkish/Greek coffee using a briki.

I am a warm and friendly host. I am happy to share the amazing secrets of London with you which I have accumulated while living here for 18 years. 

I am pleased to say that through Airbnb I have had excellent conversations and interactions with people from 29 different countries since I joined Airbnb in 2016. 
In June 2016, I travelled through France for almost a month and via Airbnb stayed in Private rooms in people's flat and was most impressed by the hosts and the hospitality. During that time I had put my entire flat on Airbnb.After coming back from France I started to put my spare room in my flat on Airbnb.

I love my flat. I have decorated it a bit like me, modern yet homely with a personal human touch. 

I am into meditation and energy and believe my flat has plenty of positive energy. I am learning modern dance and love the eclectic things that London provides from Wilton's music hall, Speak easy bars to vibrancy of Brick Lane street. 

I have worked in the banking sector and the charity sector and now run my own small business. 

I hope to host guests from all the countries that have Airbnb. 

I hope you enjoy staying at my place and I enjoy staying at yours. 

Until then, have a great day.

I find it hard to rate one country over the other as I've loved all the places I've ever visited. India captured my heart in a way others have yet to; the colours, the food, people and the sheer diversity of the country. I even loved the crazy roads.

Most people would describe me as laid back, friendly and dependable.

My hosting style:
Im a big believer in the phrase:  ""Live and let live.""
As such, my approach is to allow guests to be comfortable and to feel at home. Im quiet friendly and I love to talk to people from all walks of life, finding out about their world. But if you just need a quiet place to rest, thats fine aswell.

I love to see live performances,  especially at the theatre. I also enjoy comedy, music and sports sometimes. 

Im quite passionate about food - cooking, eating and sharing! These days I'm quite strict with myself and I try to eat healthy stuff no matter what but im very open to other peoples food and cooking preferences.

I love to travel and tend to travel to far away places so I still have lots of Europe to get to know. But the more people I meet the more curious I am about exploring!

Our mission is to make sure that both guests and hosts have the best possible experience of sharing their homes. All the properties we list here are cleaned and prepared by our team before arrival with fresh linen and towels provided during each stay.  We do our best to always have someone to meet you at the apartment to hand over the keys and and offer advice and guidance about the local area. We like to keep the lines of communication open so my team and I are always a message or call away. When we're not busy with Property Management, we love to take some time out to enjoy this lovely city. Favourite places are the Royal Opera House and the Serpentine Lido in Hyde Park.

Another road takes you
Into a world you were never in.
 
New strangers on other paths await.
New places that have never seen you
Will startle a little at your entry.
Old places that know you well
Will pretend nothing
Changed since your last visit.
 
When you travel, you find yourself
Alone in a different way,
More attentive now
To the self you bring along,
Your more subtle eye watching
You abroad; and how what meets you
Touches that part of the heart
That lies low at home:
 
How you unexpectedly attune
To the timbre in some voice,
Opening in conversation
You want to take in
To where your longing
Has pressed hard enough
Inward, on some unsaid dark,
To create a crystal of insight
You could not have known
You needed
To illuminate
Your way.
 
When you travel,
A new silence
Goes with you,
And if you listen,
You will hear
What your heart would
Love to say.
 
A journey can become a sacred thing:
Make sure, before you go,
To take the time
To bless your going forth,
To free your heart of ballast
So that the compass of your soul
Might direct you toward
The territories of spirit
Where you will discover
More of your hidden life,
And the urgencies
That deserve to claim you.
 
May you travel in an awakened way,
Gathered wisely into your inner ground;
That you may not waste the invitations
Which wait along the way to transform you.
 
May you travel safely, arrive refreshed,
And live your time away to its fullest;
Return home more enriched, and free
To balance the gift of days which call you.

Hello! Salut! Hola! Ciao! Ni Hao! Привет!

My name is Roman, before UK I used to live in US, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.  I am an Engineer by education, Chef by passion and Entrepreneur by spirit.  I was engaged in a number of projects across different fields of interest, and I've lived in London since 2015.  Living here is very challenging but also very rewarding in many ways.  London is an amazing city and I want all the guests to experience the diverse beat and spirit that London has to offer. 

I enjoy traveling a lot but I enjoy hosting even more.  I like everything that is part of a peer-to-peer sharing economy.  Empty rooms, parked cars, unused tools, even dusty books, all of these can be made to work for other people and reward those whom it belongs to. 

So I'm helping people I know or have been recommended to in running their properties when they're away or busy with other things.  I enjoy engaging with travelers, answering questions, and providing some local info and advice. 

My other interests include cooking, hiking, kayaking, cycling and motorcycling, with lots of trips by foot, wheels and pedals already accomplished and many more to come.  Not to forget gardening and wild herbs and fungi foraging for my fusion recipes. 

I would be very happy to meet you in London and make sure that your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.

Hello! Salut! Hola! Ciao! Ni Hao! Привет!

My name is Roman, before UK I used to live in US, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.  I am an Engineer by education, Chef by passion and Entrepreneur by spirit.  I was engaged in a number of projects across different fields of interest, and I've lived in London since 2015.  Living here is very challenging but also very rewarding in many ways.  London is an amazing city and I want all the guests to experience the diverse beat and spirit that London has to offer. 

I enjoy traveling a lot but I enjoy hosting even more.  I like everything that is part of a peer-to-peer sharing economy.  Empty rooms, parked cars, unused tools, even dusty books, all of these can be made to work for other people and reward those whom it belongs to. 

So I'm helping people I know or have been recommended to in running their properties when they're away or busy with other things.  I enjoy engaging with travelers, answering questions, and providing some local info and advice. 

My other interests include cooking, hiking, kayaking, cycling and motorcycling, with lots of trips by foot, wheels and pedals already accomplished and many more to come.  Not to forget gardening and wild herbs and fungi foraging for my fusion recipes. 

I would be very happy to meet you in London and make sure that your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.

My name is Dina, I'm Italian but I live in London, as all of you I love travelling around the world and I enjoy it even more when a simple trip became a real life experience, I believe that renting a flat, villa or houseboat really gives you the opportunity to experience a everyday life experience in the city your in! it enhance the experience and help you understand how would it be living in there. I am currently studying design in London and I'm a big fan of museums and books.

My fiance, Tanaka is easy-going and loves a good drink and a chat in local pubs (of which there are a few nice ones to choose from) and enjoys news / current affairs. Tanaka is also a 'co-host' on Air BnB as you will be staying in our place, so either he or I will contact you when you make a booking or have any questions : )

We love going for a stroll in Victoria Park or dining out in Shoreditch so we're happy to give you tips and advice on the local area as well. 

We both work in the City so you'll have the place to yourself most days and can go and come as you please. 

London is a great City and East London has a lot to see ""off-the-beaten-track"" so lots to do and absorb. 

If you have any questions - feel free to get in touch, Tanaka or I will get back to you as soon as we can. Otherwise we hope to see you soon & if we're not the right listing for you, not to worry- have a great time in London all the same!

It was built on top of the demolished rookery, the works were begun by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1893 and completed by the recently formed London County Council. It was, arguably, the world's first council estate.

I moved to London from China 5 years ago for my master degree and I've lived here ever since. London is an amazing city and I really enjoy staying here. I love meeting different people all over the world, visiting famous museums and art galleries.

I start to do Airbnb business with my business partner Niki since 2019. And it is such fun! Hosting guests from all different cultures, from all over the world and with my passion for travel. Although my motivation to list on Airbnb was financial in nature, I really enjoy providing my guests with the best experience possible.

I live on-site and I'm available if you need anything. I consider myself as easy going as they come. If you want me around to help out I'll try to accommodate, but if you would prefer I left you to discover London on your own, that works just fine as well. 

I believe that everything happens for a reason and trust that if I follow my intuition, good things will come my way.

I look forward to hosting you!

It's no longer about drinking warm white wine out of plastic cups at a gallery – now Shoreditch drinking is all about supremely brilliant cocktails at some of London's best bars – some of the world's best bars, in fact. The pubs are excellent – authentic East End boozers with world-class drinks menus. And some of London's best restaurants, too – more inventive and creative than many of their central London counterparts, often in interesting, re-purposed venues.<br /><br />Shoreditch was the playground of the Great Brit Artists of the Nineties. Jay Jopling's neighbourhood-defining White Cube may have decamped to Bermondsey, but the East End remains home to galleries, contemporary artists and makers essential to the capital's creative spirit.

I always enjoy to meet new people around the world and exchange stories, this always excites me when hosting my apartment. I’m happily to introduce you to the area, and tell you all about it why I fell in love with Shoreditch, if you planing to stay over and the weekends ,then you must pay a visit at the markets nearby. We have very unique markets with walking distance, that offers huge range of items such as jewellery, art, or mug and hat. I’m sure you will always find some unique piece that suits you. 

If you are here for a little city escape, my home will be just the perfect location for it. Brick lane, Liverpool Street, and all the best restaurant and bars are just few mins walk. Plus Hoxton station is just right behind the apartment. However, the easiest way I find, is the bus stop right across the road, and it would take you directly to Covent Garden, Tottenham Court Road, and Oxford Circus (15-30mins) If you still prefers underground, Old street station and Liverpool Street station are about 10 mins walk. 

This is the first home I ever had, so I really put all my heart to it to make it beautiful and cosy. I been living here with my baby cat Polar just over a year now, we loves here so much and hope you do as well. 

Polar is the cutest cat ever that adores attention from people, if I’m not at home, and he start crying just give him a little stroke and I’m sure he will quiet down. In the most of the time you will often find him passed out (sleeping) in sofa, donning chair, table, or your bed. Just bear in mind he might sleep with you if you don’t close your door.
