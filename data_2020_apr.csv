Hello! Salut! Hola! Ciao! Ni Hao! Привет!

My name is Roman, before UK I used to live in US, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.  I am an Engineer by education, Chef by passion and Entrepreneur by spirit.  I was engaged in a number of projects across different fields of interest, and I've lived in London since 2015.  Living here is very challenging but also very rewarding in many ways.  London is an amazing city and I want all the guests to experience the diverse beat and spirit that London has to offer. 

I enjoy traveling a lot but I enjoy hosting even more.  I like everything that is part of a peer-to-peer sharing economy.  Empty rooms, parked cars, unused tools, even dusty books, all of these can be made to work for other people and reward those whom it belongs to. 

So I'm helping people I know or have been recommended to in running their properties when they're away or busy with other things.  I enjoy engaging with travelers, answering questions, and providing some local info and advice. 

My other interests include cooking, hiking, kayaking, cycling and motorcycling, with lots of trips by foot, wheels and pedals already accomplished and many more to come.  Not to forget gardening and wild herbs and fungi foraging for my fusion recipes. 

I would be very happy to meet you in London and make sure that your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.
