I am very lucky that I can enjoy all of these and can now share them with visitors via airbnb.

Four random selections from our collection aboard:
CDs: Bach Cantatas, Eva Cassidy, Gipsy Kings, Massive Attack
DVDs: Sunrise, When Harry Met Sally, Of Gods and Men, The Birds
Vinyl: Stevie Nicks, Jim Reeves, Purcell, Lalo
Books: Simon Raven, PG Woodhouse, Rem Koolhaus

A keen amateur cook, I look forward to welcoming guests with a few treats.
Travel for me is simple but comfortable - I take a lot of things with me to make life a little better (notorious for taking bentos on planes and refusing all provided in-flight food, much to delight of flight crew!).

My favourite place to stay is Therme Vals designed by Peter Zumthor. I try to make regular pilgrimages to this shrine of food, architecture and relaxation - perfect in every way!

I am passionate about sharing London and Maxime (our barge) with visitors and giving a unique insight into hidden London and life on the water.

Look forward to welcoming you aboard.

It is I think, the most fun area of Central London hence its popularity. It is full of restaurants and nice bars, plus its next to many tourist destinations and galleries etc.   

We work with local residents and a few property owners who wish to make use of Airbnb but are too occupied with careers and life commitments to use it personally, plus a few of our own apartments. 

I ensure the service and apartments are presented to my high standards. You may also meet or speak with Daiany and Charlie who help me manage the properties. Charlie was born just outside London and has lived inner city for the past ten years. Daiany is from Portugal and now lives in Central London with her family. We have realised it can be a job for all hours so we share the responsibilities.

We love exploring 'off the beaten track' places, but now that we are starting a family, are probably moving more toward exploring cities and taking in culture and food.

We have really enjoyed using Airbnb as guests, and love the feeling of being in a local neighborhood when visiting foreign cities.  We love the effort Airbnb hosts make to welcome their guests and give them local knowledge, and we look forward to providing the same to guests visiting our amazing city of London.  Our favourite destinations have been Colombia, Vietnam, and Albania.

We live in Peckham, an inner city London neighborhood.  We love how it combines its own  unique buzz with amazing transport links to the whole of London.  Since we moved here 6 years ago, Peckham has morphed from a gritty working class neighbourhood to a creative hub, with a constant stream of new eateries, pop-ups, and exhibitions.  The heart of this community is Franks, a bar on the top of a multistory car park, now an open air exhibition centre, which attracts throngs from across the city to drink cheap cocktails while enjoying the incredible views over the whole city.

Peckham Rye itself retains a lot of it’s grit, with international food stores and cafes interspersed with Hipster bars and pizzarias.  Move a couple of blocks closer to our flat and you find Belenden Rd, a gentrified foodie haven with an ever increasing array of independent restaurants that regularly feature in London’s best places to eat.

For us, the best things about living in London are the culture (Laura) and the architecture and bakeries (Steve).

I’ve been living in Bermondsey for about 9 years now and adore it, mainly for the incredible array of local markets and really good quality local independent restaurants.

I love travelling and try to visit a few new places each year; in November I'm off to trek the Sahara. In my spare time I can be found reading (1000+ books in my house and counting) doing yoga, drinking lots of home made green juices, much to the disgust of my colleagues, visiting one of London's many art galleries, sober raving in the morning and listening to opera at the Royal Opera House. I also love to escape to the English Countryside and the South of France on a regular basis. 

I renovated my lovely Victorian terraced home about a year ago to amongst other things add a new kitchen, complete with American fridge/freeze, a walk in dressing room and walk in shower, and an open plan kitchen dining room onto the garden. It’s also very bright! But I’ve kept some of the original touches like the exposed brick fireplace. It’s also home to two very adorable cats who will need feeding whilst you stay!

Hello! Salut! Hola! Ciao! Ni Hao! Привет!

My name is Roman, before UK I used to live in US, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine.  I am an Engineer by education, Chef by passion and Entrepreneur by spirit.  I was engaged in a number of projects across different fields of interest, and I've lived in London since 2015.  Living here is very challenging but also very rewarding in many ways.  London is an amazing city and I want all the guests to experience the diverse beat and spirit that London has to offer. 

I enjoy traveling a lot but I enjoy hosting even more.  I like everything that is part of a peer-to-peer sharing economy.  Empty rooms, parked cars, unused tools, even dusty books, all of these can be made to work for other people and reward those whom it belongs to. 

So I'm helping people I know or have been recommended to in running their properties when they're away or busy with other things.  I enjoy engaging with travelers, answering questions, and providing some local info and advice. 

My other interests include cooking, hiking, kayaking, cycling and motorcycling, with lots of trips by foot, wheels and pedals already accomplished and many more to come.  Not to forget gardening and wild herbs and fungi foraging for my fusion recipes. 

I would be very happy to meet you in London and make sure that your stay is comfortable and enjoyable.

I give consultative pro bono advice to London community libraries and the unrepresented. I channel my love of sport to run, cycle and row for MacMillan and St Luke's hospice.

I give consultative pro bono advice to London community libraries and the unrepresented. I channel my love of sport to run, cycle and row for MacMillan and St Luke's hospice.

I enjoy hosting guests and helping them where possible within reasonable boundaries, from guests I ask nothing other than that you enjoy your stay and respect the house rules.

My hosting style is very straight forward and I believe that providing what I have advertised to you is the key for success. I hope that you enjoy the experience and I wish you a happy stay in my place in advance.

I have been an Airbnb host since 2010, at the time on a different account to which I have long lost access to.

I have moved into another apartment (a basement flat) at the same building as my partner, and now it is me welcoming you to my home!

I am someone of a cosmopolitan outlook, having lived in half a dozen countries and visited over 30 countries. I love the local London life here and interacting with local and international guests and friends.

What else about me? I drive classic cars (90s and 70s!) and I am into arthouse films, classical music and smooth nostalgic songs. My professional background is creative arts and science project and research management. I enjoy a variety of food from mild spice to super hot chili, and to burn off all those calories I work out everyday scoring long distance shots (half and three-quarter court) in basketball.

I'm 33, and a year ago I decided to hang up the security of  a corporate job and travel the world.. 18 months later I'm still travelling. 

I have lived in London for some time now but I may assuredly now say that I am entirely aware of the culture and magnificent characteristics that this vibrant city entails. Let me ensure you that this place is worth your visit and you will be surprisingly delighted by the welcoming and the liveliness atmosphere of historical London. 

I joined Airbnb because I love to travel in my spare time but now I have decided to host as well. Being a host is of high importance to me because it allows me to be helpful to the visitors, whereas I can imagine, it may be difficult to orientate yourself in the first few days of arriving at a new setting. I find it very exciting to host people from all across the world! I would count myself as a ""hands-on"" host because I believe it is essential to be there for your guest. The main rule I live by is ""treat people how you would like to be treated"", and I will be sure to treat you with the utmost respect. With that in mind, I may confidently state that I will be reliable, friendly and an organised host to make your stay as smooth as possible. 

Consequently, I decided that Airbnb is a great opportunity to be useful for travellers that come to tour and explore the incredible London. In my profile, you will be able to find a selection of accommodations to choose from based on your liking. I hope you enjoy your stay whilst I will try to provide you with immediate assistance to ensure that you have an outstanding trip! For a better experience of my guests, my listings are handled by a dedicated property management company who will do everything to guarantee that your stay will be impeccable.

Our Story
“The idea for The Gate and aparthotels was born out of traditional gate and guesthouses, where people would socialise in communal spaces then retreat to their private rooms. The gatehouses would often be right on the edge of a city, so guests could use the property as a base to easily explore the surrounding 
neighbourhoods. We wanted to recreate this offering and atmosphere for a modern audience. It’s really exciting to be launching our first aparthotel, introducing a new kind of hospitality experience to the London market - 
we cannot wait to see how our guests use the space.”

I'm a freelance creative living in our recently renovated pad in Kings Cross with my husband. 

I’m a presenter and producer for both video and audio bits and bobs these days. I have previously worked in production for BBC Songs of Praise and pre-COVID was heard co-presenting a national breakfast radio show on Premier Christian Radio.

My husband John is more of the coding-kind and we are partial to dancing, bouldering and travelling ourselves. 

We're passionate about creating a hospitable, cosy family vibe for guests staying in our home. We’ve recently renovated it and are delighted to share the space we have created with folks and hope others get to be refreshed and enjoy some peace in our little oasis of London! We absolutely love the area and can give you our best recommendations of things to do that might suit your stay. 

Do drop us a message if you are interesting in staying in our home when we are away or with us in one of our two spare rooms! 

Hopefully see you soon!

This part is always the most difficult to fill in, isn't it, so I'll just follow the guided format and share with you about 5 things I can't live without:
My God. My creditcard. My family and friends. Whatsapp. Travel 

I love going away for short breaks, anything more than 7days is too long for me.  New York is my favourite city break. If I could go to New York every weekend, I would. Lol
 
I am about to get married to my boyfriend of 10 years so it's excitement all around. We are having a destination wedding :-)
Update - 18/10/2014: We are now married!! Got hitched 07 Sep 2013. ;)

I love music, and tend to appreciate most genres. I think different music cater for different moods so when I'm melancholic then I love listening to Jazz, classical or soul.etc. 

I eat anything except red meat. This is not because of any religious or dietary obligations. I just do not have the taste for it.

Thanks to our fully managed service, when you stay in a Veeve property you can benefit from the spaciousness, personal style and relaxed feel of a home – but with all the amenities of a hotel.


Once a booking is confirmed our Customer Service team will become your main point of contact and get in touch with you to organise your arrival at the property (including airport transfers, upon request); after which our on-the-ground management team will look after all aspects of your stay, with in-stay support available to help with any queries.


We have strict cleanliness guidelines for our cleaners and all staff who enter our properties and have reinforced existing cleaning procedures in line with official WHO, British and French government guidance.


As always, our team ensure that all properties are cleaned to a professional standard before and after each stay, with increased focus on touch-point cleaning (door handles, kitchen surfaces, kettles, taps etc.).

 All staff who enter properties will follow the below procedures:

I'm a freelance creative living in our recently renovated pad in Kings Cross with my husband. 

I’m a presenter and producer for both video and audio bits and bobs these days. I have previously worked in production for BBC Songs of Praise and pre-COVID was heard co-presenting a national breakfast radio show on Premier Christian Radio.

My husband John is more of the coding-kind and we are partial to dancing, bouldering and travelling ourselves. 

We're passionate about creating a hospitable, cosy family vibe for guests staying in our home. We’ve recently renovated it and are delighted to share the space we have created with folks and hope others get to be refreshed and enjoy some peace in our little oasis of London! We absolutely love the area and can give you our best recommendations of things to do that might suit your stay.

My name is Penelope. Welcome to my home! 

I have lived in London for 16 years now but I may assuredly now say that I am entirely aware of the culture and magnificent characteristics that this vibrant city entails. Let me ensure you that this place is worth your visit and you will be surprisingly delighted by the welcoming and the liveliness atmosphere of historical London. 

In my spare time, I love travelling, meeting new people, learning languages, cultures, and cuisines. Also, I love travelling to new places and meeting people. My most enjoyed places to visit is Germany, Austria and Italy. They are fantastic places full of history and culture. So if you ever need a suggestion for a great place to eat, let me know and I would love to help you out. 

I joined Airbnb because I love to travel in my spare time but now I have decided to host as well. Being a host is of high importance to me because it allows me to be helpful to the visitors, whereas I can imagine, it may be difficult to orientate yourself in the first few days of arriving at a new setting. I find it very exciting to host people from all across the world! I would count myself as a ""hands-on"" host because I believe it is essential to be there for your guest. The main rule I live by is ""treat people how you would like to be treated"", and I will be sure to treat you with the utmost respect. With that in mind, I may confidently state that I will be reliable, friendly and an organised host to make your stay as smooth as possible. 

Consequently, I decided that Airbnb is a great opportunity to be useful for travellers that come to tour and explore the incredible London. In my profile, you will be able to find a selection of accommodations to choose from based on your liking. I hope you enjoy your stay whilst I will try to provide you with immediate assistance to ensure that you have an outstanding trip! For a better experience of my guests, my listings are handled by a dedicated property management company who will do everything to guarantee that your stay will be impeccable. I hope you enjoy your stay in London!",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5f82fbb8-11da-4889-83b5-3a101d1f8873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/5f82fbb8-11da-4889-83b5-3a101d1f8873.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1.0,4.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Greater London, England, United Kingdom",Richmond upon Thames,,51.42803,-0.34513,Entire condo,Entire home/apt,4,,1 bath,2.0,2.0,"[""Iron"", ""First aid kit"", ""Wifi"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""TV"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Kitchen"", ""Washer"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Essentials"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Cooking basics""]",90.0,4,1125,4.0,4.0,1125.0,1125.0,4.0,1125.0,,t,0,0,0,0,2023-09-07,2,0,0,2021-08-19,2021-08-27,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.5,5.0,4.0,,t,1,1,0,0,0.08
