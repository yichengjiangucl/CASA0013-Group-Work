I moved to London from China 5 years ago for my master degree and I've lived here ever since. London is an amazing city and I really enjoy staying here. I love meeting different people all over the world, visiting famous museums and art galleries.

I start to do Airbnb business with my business partner Niki since 2019. And it is such fun! Hosting guests from all different cultures, from all over the world and with my passion for travel. Although my motivation to list on Airbnb was financial in nature, I really enjoy providing my guests with the best experience possible.

I live on-site and I'm available if you need anything. I consider myself as easy going as they come. If you want me around to help out I'll try to accommodate, but if you would prefer I left you to discover London on your own, that works just fine as well. 

I believe that everything happens for a reason and trust that if I follow my intuition, good things will come my way.

I look forward to hosting you!
